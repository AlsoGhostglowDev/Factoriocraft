Although be wary, §cthis consumes LOTS of power§r.\n\nAs for your physical network, it is recommended you §ahave a power distributor or a relay in order to separate components§r, so the computers don’t get their components mixed up or use the same component.\n\nA relay may also use a §6Wireless Network Card§r of any tier to receive messages wirelessly.",
