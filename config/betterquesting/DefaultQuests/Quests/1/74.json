The Fusion Crafter is a §emulti-block structure§r, refer to the §5Draconic Evolution§r questline for information on how to construct it.\n\nTo fusion craft the Awakened Core, you will need to §eput two §6Wyvern Core§r§es on both sides, with one side containing 3 §6Awakened Draconium Ingot§r§es and 2 on the other side§r. Then simply place a §6Nether Star§r in the §6Fusion Crafting Core§r.",
