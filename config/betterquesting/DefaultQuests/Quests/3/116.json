To do this, you\u0027ll have to §eput the Ore in a §6Purification Chamber§r that is supplied with §6Oxygen§r. This will give you 3 clumps which then would go into the §6Crusher§r to be turned into dust. The §edust can now be smelted to turn into their ingot form§r.\n\n§n§lProsedure:§r\n1. Ore + Oxygen  \u003e  §6Purification Chamber§r  \u003e  Clump\n2. Clump  \u003e  §6Crusher§r  \u003e  Dust\n3. Dust  \u003e  §6Energized Smelter§r  \u003e  Ingot\n\n§7TIP: I recommend getting the Gas Upgrade for the Purification Chamber so you can save on spending too much oxygen. §r",
